# Notes

## Ada, National College for Digital Skills

Should we exclude from the experiment because it is overly specialist?


## Cheshire College South and West

Not clear if it's 2 colleges or 1 college with 3 campuses. Chose to go with 1 college. Picked the college/campus that had the same address as GIAS.


## Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College

College appears to be called 'West London College', which I've renamed it to. It's not clear if it's 1 college with 3 campuses or 3 colleges. Chose to go with 1 college.


## East Coast College

None of the address match the GIAS data or AoC data. Have gone with the address on their site.


## Eastleigh College, Fareham College, 

Eastleigh College is not in GIAS. It appears the parent is South Hampshire College Group. I've created that a parent. Fareham is part of South Hampshire College Group and is listed on GIAS. I've used the details of Fareham College to create South Hampshire College Group details. Southampton City College appears in the AoC data, but is now called City College Southampton and belongs to the same parent. I've renamed and added it to the parent.


## Heart of Yorkshire Education Group

Unclear if the college group has 1 or 2 colleges. Wakefield is a college, but hard to tell if Castleford is a college in it's own right. Have called it a second campus for now.


## Herefordshire, Ludlow and North Shropshire College

Have kept this is as 1 college. Could have been multiple, two of the sites are about 1.5 hours apart.


## Hertford Regional College

Address is slightly different from GIAS


## Inspire education group

Confusing if Inspire education group (IEG) is a college or a college group or both. It has subsidiaries – 'Peterborough College' (which it shares an address with) and 'Stamford College'. I made IEG a group and Peterborough the college. I also added Stamford college as child of IEG.


## LTE Group

Group appears to be a general edcation/training. Only one college, but I feel it's better to expose the college (The Manchester College) than the group. So I've created 1 parent with 1 college.


## Luminate Education Group

Made Luminate Education Group a parent with Leeds City College, Keighly College and Harrogate college as colleges.


## Orbital South Colleges

Made Orbital South Colleges a parent with East Surrey College and John Ruskin College as colleges.


## RNN Group

Made RNN Group a parent with Rotherham College, Dearne Valley College, North Notts College as colleges.


## Salford City College

Physical address on the site is different to GIAS. Went with address on website.


## SK Group / St Helens College

AoC data has 'SK Group'. Cannot find any info on SK Group, but the St Helens College shares the same address. Have gone with St Helens College and not created a parent.


## South Bank Colleges / Lambeth College / LSBU group

Bit hard to know if the college entity is South Bank Colleges or Lambeth College. There is also a parent of the parent "LSBU GROUP". There are 2 colleges – Lambeth College and London South Bank Technical College. Have created LSBU GROUP as a parent and Lambeth College as the college. I've not included 'London South Bank Technical College'.


## Southport Education Group / Southport College

Southport College is listed as Southport Education Group in GIAS. Cannot see another mention of Southport Education Group anywhere else so I've not created a parent.


## Sunderland College Group (Education Partnership North Tameside)

Cannot find any mention of the group. Have just listed Sunderland College.


## TEC Partnership / East Riding College

TEC Partnership is listed in AoC and GIAS. According to their site "TEC partnership comprises of:
- Grimsby Institute
- University Centre Grimsby
- Scarborough TEC
- East Riding College
- Skegness TEC
- The Academy Grimsby
- Career 6
- Modal Training. 

Only one of these is called a 'college'. I have made TEC Partnership a parent with East Riding College its only college.


## The Bedford College Group / Bedford College

AoC and GIAS list The Bedford College Group. On the The Bedford College Group site, they list several 'colleges and campuses':
- Bedford College
- Central Bedfordshire College
- National College For Motorsport
- Shuttleworth College
- Tresham College

In the older AoC data, Bedfordshire has:
- Bedford College
- Shuttleworth College
- Tresham College of Further and Higher Education

Have added all of the colleges as colleges. Picked the Kettering Campus as the campus for Tresham College because that is the address for Tresham College of Further and Higher Education in the old AoC data.


## The Cornwall College Group

The Cornwall College Group lists:
- Cornwall College
- Duchy College
- Bicton College

And a couple of other training facilities.

Hard to decide if this is a parent because The Cornwall College Group:
- does not have a website
- LinkedIn page says "Cornwall College is the UK's third largest further education college... The college comprises of seven campuses across the county of Cornwall and incorporates both Duchy College (two campuses), Falmouth Marine School and Bicton College in Devon."

But wanted to list Duchy College or Bicton College, and wanted to show the parent for all 3 because if I didn't it feels inconsistent with some where the colleges appears as related to each other as this but have clearer parents.


## The Education Training Collective

The Education Training Collective lists:
- Bede Sixth Form College
- NETA Training Group
- Redcar and Cleveland College
- Stockton Riverside College
- The Skills Academy

I have created The Education Training Collective as a parent and listed Redcar and Cleveland College and Stockton Riverside College as colleges.

The Education Training Collective has a website of its own, but the two colleges are pretty close and could be considered campuses.


## The National College for Advanced Transport and Infrastructure

Deleted because there is an article saying that it ceased to exist in July 2023. https://feweek.co.uk/former-national-college-to-officially-close-down/


## The South Thames College Group

Created a parent "The South Thames College Group" and colleges:
- Kingston College
- Carshalton College
- South Thames College
- Merton College

This one is a little borderline.


## The West Herts College Group

Made this a parent with 2 colleges:
- West Herts College
- Barnfield College


## Windsor Forest Colleges Group / Langley College

Windsor Forest Colleges Group looks to be a legit group. It has 3 colleges and 1 other training provision. The other 2 colleges are sixth forms. I created Windsor Forest Colleges Group as a parent with Langely as it’s college.


## Trafford College Group

For our purposes Trafford College Group isn't a parent because the 'group' offers other training provision, but no other colleges. Have flattened the group to be the Trafford College.


## Truro and Penwith College

Could be 2 colleges ('Truro College' and 'Penwith College'). Went with 1 as they don't seem to have a distinct identity.


## Tyne Coast College

Appears to have multiple colleges. Went with 1 because the website describes them as 'sites' and they're all local.


## United Colleges Group

Created a group with City of Westminster College and College of North West London.


## Warwickshire College Group

This group appears to have 6 colleges:
- Royal Leamington Spa College
- Rugby College
- Moreton Morrell College
- Pershore College
- Warwick Trident College

Created a group for Warwickshire College Group. Moreton Morrell College and Pershore College appear to be land-based and have not been included.
